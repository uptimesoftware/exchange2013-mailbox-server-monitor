###### Allow Powershell Remoting on the Remotehost (Exchange Mailbox Server)
Run Powershell 2.0 on the Remotehost and run the following Cmdlet.
> Enable-PSRemoting

This command starts the WinRM service if itâ€™s not allready started and sets the startup type to automatic. Adds firewall exceptions for WS-Management communications and creates a listener to accept requests.

###### Add Trusted Hosts on the Localcomputer (Windows up.time Monitoring Station)
On the Local Computer run Powershell and run the following Cmdlet. This allows you to connect to any host. It also starts WinRM if its not already started.
> Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts *

After that you may have to restart the WinRM service
> Restart-Service winrm -Force
